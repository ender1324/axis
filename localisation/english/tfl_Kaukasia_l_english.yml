#EVENT#
RKK.1.t: "The Black Mountains"
RKK.1.d: "The land of Caucasia is home to different ethnics and religion groups such as Islam and Christianity. The land was invaded trought it's history by numerous empires such as the Mongols, the Turks, the Persians and the Russians, who dominated the region for the longest of time. During the Russian civil war, many groups of Caucasia break free of the Russian's rule, only to be conquered by the Soviets years later. Then, after the defeat of the Soviet Union by the German war machine, the Reichskommissariat Kaukasia was etablished.\n\nThe current Reichskommissar is Emil Maurice. While the official reason is due to a promotion, the real one is due to a controversy linked to Maurice's problematic ancestors who clashed with his loyality to the Reich. The result is a bored Maurice who see his post more of a chore than a proud task. The life in the colony is not better, the natives work as laborers in the factories and oil fields, with many compagnies from around Europe locating their industry here. The sky is black and the days are dull."
RKK.1.a: "Interesting"

RKK.2.t: "Our Place In The Reich"
RKK.2.d: "Where does Kaukasia place itself in the Reich? The Reichskommissariat don't have much contact with the Fatherland, and it's the least funded. The Reichskommissariat, compared to other like Rubland is mostly stable, even if their trouble in the fields. For many, Kaukasus feel like a prison for those that the Reich don't have much interest in. In the cities, the Germans population are aristocrats that live in the safest and most richest streets while the garrisons make sure to make the locals stay in place.\n\nIt's to be asked what are we and what are we going to be in the future, with Maurice's tired motivation and the many factions inside fighting each other. We will see what fate will decide."
RKK.2.a: "Let's hope fate will favorite us"

RKK.3.t: "The Tourist Attractions"
RKK.3.d: "Since the start of the project, the number of German tourists multiplied by 3. With the explosive tourism industry, many old abandonned buildings were brought back as hotels and restaurants. During these time, the Kaukasian security force has made much more effort to hunt down any partisan who would harm our precious tourists. The result are looking promising for the future of Kaukasia."
RKK.3.a: "Glory to Kaukasia"

RKK.4.t: "The Conference"
RKK.4.d: "Like every years, a conference take place in the Kaukasian's government. During these conferences, a lists of issues and good news from the previous year are discuted over, these conferences include all members that serve in the authority of the Reichskommissariat wich include collaborators. The conference about eveything that happened in 1952 will soon take place, and we will make sure that everything is good. Recently, we got many letters from the Georgian collaborators who demand an important discussion on the question of Batumi, taken by the Turks, in the coming conference. Let's hope we will make everyone happy."
RKK.4.a: "There not time to waste"

RKK.5.t: "The Three Realms"
RKK.5.d: "In the system that it's the Reichskommissariat, two clogs are shown to be an important piece of this machine. The Georgian and Azeri collaborators are used to enforce the authority of the government and the loyality of their people, in exchange, we place them highter in the racial hierarchy while they are obviously under their Aryan masters. The main objective being to cause a conflict between each ethnics and weaken any resistance."
RKK.5.a: "As they say, divide and rule"

RKK.6.t: "1953's Conference"
RKK.6.d: "Today begin the annual conference of the government. Like alway, there are complaints and discord, many said that Reichskommissar Maurice lack too much effort and ambitions for the Reichskommissariat. On the collaborator's side, the Georgians are complainting about the city of Batumi being under Turkish control and that it represent a tragedy for the population. On good news, the number of attack from the partisan movements reduced compared to 1951 and a increasment in oil production."
RKK.6.a: "Will we continue like that?"

RKK.7.t: "A Suprise Announcement"
RKK.7.d: "As the day passed like any days in Kaukasia, the Reichskommissar Emil Maurice convened all high-ranking members of the government to let out a suprise announcement : He was requested by the Fatherland to come in Germania and participate in a meeting with the ministry of the eastern territories. For that, a private plane from Germania will come in 5 days to pick him up.\n\nThe Reichskommissar stated that his venue in Germania will last 1 weeks. During these times, a provisional government will be put in place to replace the Reichskommissar."
RKK.7.a: "What could the ministry want?"

RKK.8.t: "Toward Germania"
RKK.8.d: "Finally, the days where Maurice will flee Kaukasia to meet the ministry arrived. Toward the morning, Maurice entered to the private aeroport of the government and took the plane sent by the Fatherland. During his time out of Kaukasia, the provisional government ruled by the highest ranked members will be in control of the Reichskommissariat."
RKK.8.a: "Goodbye Reichskommissar"

RKK.9.t: "Revelation"
RKK.9.d: "Today, a troublesome new shacked both Kaukasia and Germania. After Maurice flee with his plane, we contacted Germania to see if the Reichskommissar arrived safe. On the other side, Germania were confused, and for a good reason, they never requested Maurice to Germania, or even sent a plane there, nor Maurice arrived at the capital. After learning that, many seemed to theorize about where Maurice flee. After an huge investigation, we found out that Maurice was contacted by America and promised to let him go to U.S.A if he gave them informations about the German Reich, the plane that was sent was actually piloted by a American pilot. This caused a huge scandal in the Reichskommissariat. The provisional government will elect a new Reichskommissar in the next few days."
RKK.9.a: "Damn traitor!"

RKK.10.t: "The New Reichskommissar"
RKK.10.d: "After the revelation of the traitorous act of Emil Maurice, the colony is left without any Reichskommissar. After many discussions, we have found three potential candidate : Hans Hüttig, a loyal member for the reich and one of the few former SS who refused to join Himmler's fiefdom. Odilo Globotschnig, another former SS who stayed with us, but this time, his loyality for the Reich is often questionned and Otto Bräutigam, a reformist who claim that the Kaukasian government should be more gentle with the local population while still serving the Reich. The fate of Kaukasia will be decided now."
RKK.10.a: "Hans Hüttig"
RKK.10.b: "Odilo Globotschnig"
RKK.10.c: "Otto Bräutigam"
