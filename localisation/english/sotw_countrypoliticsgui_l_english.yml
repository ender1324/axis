Born in 1926 during the reign of her grandfather George V, she was the eldest daughter of the king's second son, Albert, Prince of York. When her father acceded to the throne in 1936 following the abdication of his brother, a young Elizabeth became the heir apparent to the British throne.\n\nDuring the Second World War, a then-fourteen Princess Elizabeth fled Britain to their dominion in Canada, her father and the rest of the royal family and government joining her following the fall of the British Isles. The British crown was left divided, with George VI claiming the throne from Canada and the former king Edward placed on the throne by the Germans. Elizabeth acceded to this competition when her father died in 1952, leaving her as Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nHer reign has been respectable, compared to her adversary in London. Scaling back the crown's major sway over their Canadian hosts, she has won the people of the domains she still lays claim over. But as tensions begin to rise again across the globe, the Canadians are starting to grow tired of hosting the large community of British exiles and their politics.§!\n§RIf Canada commits too strongly to the British cause, there will be dire consequences...§!"

 ENG_SL_Edward_VIII_idea_desc: "§LThere have been dozens of English Kings. Edward the Confessor, William the Conqueror, Edward III, Henry VIII. All have been crowned in Westminster Abbey, surrounded by the Lords of the land. But one in particular in the illustrious line, is not like the others. This outliner in Edward VIII - the most hated English King in history.\n\nBorn in the year 1894, when the British Empire ruled over one of the Greatest Empires in history, Edward’s parents were often absent from their children’s lives. When his father became George V in 1910, Edward was made Prince of Wales, and when World War One broke out in 1914, Edward applied to serve on the front but was prohibited. Instead, he spent his time visiting the troops and meeting with his mistresses.\n\nAfter the War, Edward began touring both the Empire and the wider world. He became an International fashion symbol, admired by Men and adored by Women across the globe. In 1936 when his father died, Edward became King of the United Kingdom, but in a shocking move, abdicated to marry Wallis Simpson, a twice-divorced American actress. Now in exile in continental Europe, he began falling in with the Nazi Party, which he saw as the savior of European civilization. When the Second World War began, Edward advised them to bomb Britain, to force the British government to sue for peace. With the success of Operation Sealion, Edward was once again placed on a throne in London, but this time not that of his United Kingdom. Instead, for the first time since Queen Anne, England was alone once more, axed off from Scotland by the German fist.\n\nNow, years on from his restoration, Edward is a lonely, unhappy man. With the ruling Union Movement and Prime Minister Fuller being unwilling to involve him in government, Edward has devoted himself to domestic pursuits, with Queen Wallis. He dreams of one day reasserting his power, restoring the old system of a beloved and influential Monarchy, but perhaps even he knows that his days are numbered if he tries to...§!"
