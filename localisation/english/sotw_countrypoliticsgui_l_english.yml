 GER_SL_adolf_hitler_idea_desc: "Adolf Hitler, the architect of Europe's darkest hour, now languishes in the twilight of his reign. In the aftermath of his victory in World War II, Hitler's dreams of a Thousand Year Reich seemed within grasp. The conquered lands of Europe lay prostrate before him, their peoples subjugated and their resistance crushed beneath the iron heel of German supremacy. §RYet, victory came at a cost.§!\n\nBy 1953, the Reich stands as a colossus, stretching from the Atlantic shores to the distant steppes of Russia. But beneath the rotten triumph lies a structure teetering on the brink of collapse. The strains of war have taken their toll, plunging the German economy into turmoil and stretching the resources of the Reich to their limits.\n\nHitler's once unassailable grip on power has faltered, his mind now clouded by the ravages of schizophrenia. In 1949, as his condition deteriorated, the §0inner circle§! seized control, relegating him to the sidelines of power. Now, the decisions that shape the destiny of the Reich are made not by Hitler's vision, but by the machinations of his \"trusted\" ministers and the newly empowered Reichspräsident who had been selected as a successor by his will before.\n\nAs Hitler fades into obscurity, spending his days in isolated vacation homes, his legacy becomes increasingly tarnished. The Reich finds itself overstretched, its grip on vast swathes of territory from Poland to Western Russia tenuous at best. The once mighty war machine, fueled by conquest and fueled by ideology, now struggles to maintain control amidst simmering resistance and resentment from subjugated populations. §RAnd the partisans don't seem to be giving up...§!\n\nBut even in his twilight years, the specter of Hitler's legacy looms large over Europe. The scars of his reign, marked by discrimination, genocide, and unspeakable atrocities, continue to haunt the collective consciousness of those oppressed by it. As Hitler's grip on reality weakens, his final days serve as a grim reminder of the dangers of unchecked ambition and the horrors of tyranny. In the end, the Führer who once held the fate of nations in his hands fades into history, §Ras even the mightiest of tyrants are ultimately mortal.§!\n\n§0Even if Germany has not given up on its dreams of greatness yet, it is clear it won't be Hitler who completes them...§!"

As the wehrmacht occupied the country, he seized the opportunity to advance his agenda, pleading for funding from Germany and unifying organizations sympathetic to the Nazi cause.\n\nWith the establishment of the collaborationist Danish government, Lembcke's influence grew, with the German administration finding him as a useful puppet to use in the future. As the forerunner of the Danish National Socialist Party, he positioned himself as a champion of Danish interests, promoting collaboration with the Axis powers in exchange for false promises of sovereignty and independence.\n\nAfter the war had ended, Lembcke had already ensured the DNSAP would be the ruling party of the new Danish state. The democratic-aligned government either fled or was imprisoned and Denmark was reorganized into a Reichkommissariat for the new world order. In his role as the Fører of the population and a key figure in the civilian administration, Lembcke works closely with the Reich's Plenipotentiary, to ensure the smooth implementation of Germanization policies. While cooperating with the wishes of Germania, he also seeks to advance the interests of his own party, using his position of power to consolidate influence and promote his vision, even one day having ambition of rising to the proper Plenipotentiary to the Reich.\n\nYet, with all the betreyal and collaboration, Best knows the power structure does not allow for that to happen, and with Lembckes allegiance torn between the aspirations of his party and the demands of his German overlords, the status quo in Reichkommissariat Danemark will continue for years to come...§!"

His tenure as Minister President of Norway during the German occupation saw the imposition of drastic measures and the handover of the sovergnity of the country, all in service to the Axis cause.\n\nToday, Quisling finds himself ensconced in a gilded cage, his once grand ambitions reduced to mere ceremonial duties. The real power in Norway lies not with him, but with the Reichskommissar Josef Terboven, who deftly manipulates the levers of control behind the scenes, leaving Quisling marginalized and impotent in matters of state.\n\nThe man who once envisioned himself to a new order under the banner of Nasjonal Samling finds himself relegated to a mere figurehead, stripped of authority by his erstwhile allies turned overlords. Despite his diminished status, Quisling harbors secret ambitions of reclaiming power for himself. However, the German administration, backed by Terboven's grip on the region, ensures that Quisling remains nothing more than a figurehead, incapable of influencing any significant decisions.§!"

This outliner in Edward VIII - the most hated English King in its history.\n\nBorn in the year 1894, when the British Empire ruled over one of the Greatest Empires in history, Edward’s parents were often absent from their children’s lives. When his father became George V in 1910, Edward was made Prince of Wales, and when World War One broke out in 1914, Edward applied to serve on the front but was prohibited. Instead, he spent his time visiting the troops and meeting with his mistresses.\n\nAfter the War, Edward began touring both the Empire and the wider world. He became an International fashion symbol, admired by Men and adored by Women across the globe. In 1936 when his father died, Edward became King of the United Kingdom, but in a shocking move, abdicated to marry Wallis Simpson, a twice-divorced American actress. Now in exile in continental Europe, he began falling in with the Nazi Party, which he saw as the savior of European civilization. When the Second World War began, Edward advised them to bomb Britain, to force the British government to sue for peace. With the success of Operation Sealion, Edward was once again placed on a throne in London, but this time not that of his United Kingdom. Instead, for the first time since Queen Anne, England was alone once more, axed off from Scotland by the German fist.\n\nNow, years on from his restoration, Edward is a lonely, unhappy man. With the ruling Union Movement and Prime Minister Fuller being unwilling to involve him in government, Edward has devoted himself to domestic pursuits, with Queen Wallis. He dreams of one day reasserting his power, restoring the old system of a beloved and influential Monarchy, but perhaps even he knows that his days are numbered if he tries to...§!"
