 GER_SL_adolf_hitler_idea_desc: "Adolf Hitler, the architect of Europe's darkest hour, now languishes in the twilight of his reign. In the aftermath of his victory in World War II, Hitler's dreams of a Thousand Year Reich seemed within grasp. The conquered lands of Europe lay prostrate before him, their peoples subjugated and their resistance crushed beneath the iron heel of German supremacy. §RYet, victory came at a cost.§!\n\nBy 1953, the Reich stands as a colossus, stretching from the Atlantic shores to the distant steppes of Russia. But beneath the facade of triumph lies a nation teetering on the brink of collapse. The strains of war have taken their toll, plunging the German economy into turmoil and stretching the resources of the Reich to their limits.\n\nHitler's once unassailable grip on power has faltered, his mind now clouded by the ravages of schizophrenia. In 1949, as his condition deteriorated, the §0inner circle§! seized control, relegating him to the sidelines of power. Now, the decisions that shape the destiny of the Reich are made not by Hitler's vision, but by the machinations of his \"trusted\" ministers and the newly empowered Reichspräsident who had been selected as a successor by his will before.\n\nAs Hitler fades into obscurity, spending his days in isolated vacation homes, his legacy becomes increasingly tarnished. The Reich finds itself overstretched, its grip on vast swathes of territory from Poland to Western Russia tenuous at best. The once mighty war machine, fueled by conquest and fueled by ideology, now struggles to maintain control amidst simmering resistance and resentment from subjugated populations. §RAnd the partisans don't seem to be giving up...§!\n\nBut even in his twilight years, the specter of Hitler's legacy looms large over Europe. The scars of his reign, marked by discrimination, genocide, and unspeakable atrocities, continue to haunt the collective consciousness of those oppressed by it. As Hitler's grip on reality weakens, his final days serve as a grim reminder of the dangers of unchecked ambition and the horrors of tyranny. In the end, the Führer who once held the fate of nations in his hands fades into history, §Ras even the mightiest of tyrants are ultimately mortal.§!\n\n§0Even if Germany has not given up on its dreams of greatness yet, it is clear it won't be Hitler who completes them...§!"

Born in 1926 during the reign of her grandfather George V, she was the eldest daughter of the king's second son, Albert, Prince of York. When her father acceded to the throne in 1936 following the abdication of his brother, a young Elizabeth became the heir apparent to the British throne.\n\nDuring the Second World War, a then-fourteen Princess Elizabeth fled Britain to their dominion in Canada, her father and the rest of the royal family and government joining her following the fall of the British Isles. The British crown was left divided, with George VI claiming the throne from Canada and the former king Edward placed on the throne by the Germans. Elizabeth acceded to this competition when her father died in 1952, leaving her as Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nHer reign has been respectable, compared to her adversary in London. Scaling back the crown's major sway over their Canadian hosts, she has won the people of the domains she still lays claim over. But as tensions begin to rise again across the globe, the Canadians are starting to grow tired of hosting the large community of British exiles and their politics.§!\n§RIf Canada commits too strongly to the British cause, there will be dire consequences...§!"

 ENG_SL_Edward_VIII_idea_desc: "§LThere have been dozens of English Kings. Edward the Confessor, William the Conqueror, Edward III, Henry VIII. All have been crowned in Westminster Abbey, surrounded by the Lords of the land. But one in particular in the illustrious line, is not like the others. This outliner in Edward VIII - the most hated English King in its history.\n\nBorn in the year 1894, when the British Empire ruled over one of the Greatest Empires in history, Edward’s parents were often absent from their children’s lives. When his father became George V in 1910, Edward was made Prince of Wales, and when World War One broke out in 1914, Edward applied to serve on the front but was prohibited. Instead, he spent his time visiting the troops and meeting with his mistresses.\n\nAfter the War, Edward began touring both the Empire and the wider world. He became an International fashion symbol, admired by Men and adored by Women across the globe. In 1936 when his father died, Edward became King of the United Kingdom, but in a shocking move, abdicated to marry Wallis Simpson, a twice-divorced American actress. Now in exile in continental Europe, he began falling in with the Nazi Party, which he saw as the savior of European civilization. When the Second World War began, Edward advised them to bomb Britain, to force the British government to sue for peace. With the success of Operation Sealion, Edward was once again placed on a throne in London, but this time not that of his United Kingdom. Instead, for the first time since Queen Anne, England was alone once more, axed off from Scotland by the German fist.\n\nNow, years on from his restoration, Edward is a lonely, unhappy man. With the ruling Union Movement and Prime Minister Fuller being unwilling to involve him in government, Edward has devoted himself to domestic pursuits, with Queen Wallis. He dreams of one day reasserting his power, restoring the old system of a beloved and influential Monarchy, but perhaps even he knows that his days are numbered if he tries to...§!"
