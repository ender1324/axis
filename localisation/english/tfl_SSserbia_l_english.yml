 SSW_black_hole_europe: "The Black Hole of Europe"
 SSW_black_hole_europe_desc: "\"Information doesn't travel easily in Südslawiens; Citizens are disconnected from the rest of Europe, and even news from within the state reaches us only through the whims of the leadership. Any attempt to influence opinion abroad or gather intelligence within Südslawiens is met with resistance from the Sicherheitsdienst.\" §W- Abwehr Südslawiens Status Report #3§!\n\n\"Our agents struggle to extract any meaningful information from their targets. The people of Südslawiens live in constant fear, making them tight-lipped and unwilling to share anything that could compromise their safety. Even within our ranks, knowledge is tightly controlled, creating obstacles for those seeking to coordinate operations or plan future actions. We must find ways to break down these walls of silence if we hope to maintain our grip on power in the Serbian region.\" §W- Abwehr Südslawiens Intelligence Report #5§!"
 
 SSW_new_blood_old_land: "New Blood, Old Land"
 SSW_new_blood_old_land_desc: "\"As we continue to purge our lands of subhumans, our empty cities require new pure inhabitants. We will import thousands of Germanic prisoners from the territories of the Reich, filling the vacant land left behind. These individuals are carefully selected for their potential to contribute to our society, either through labour or military service, ensuring the longevity and prosperity of the Arisches-Siedlungsgebiet.\" §W- Südslawiens Repopulation Plan Intelligence§!\n\n\"The influx of prisoners from the reich provides a steady stream of fresh blood to repopulate our cities. While some view this as a temporary solution, the Reichsfuhrer-SS recognizes it as an opportunity to strengthen our society by integrating those deemed fit for survival. Through hard work and harsh discipline, these barbarians can prove their worth and earn their place in our new, thriving Aryan world order.\" §W- Südslawiens Repopulation Plan Intelligence§!"

 SSW_burning_structure: "The Burning Structure"
 SSW_burning_structure_desc: "\"Outside our established supply networks and road connections between cities, the territory outside of Prinz-Eugen is in complete disarray and considered under partisan control. Our troops on their way to Torzumosten often get harassed by partisan forces and our attempts to reclaim control over the rural areas have failed due to the incompetence of the penal-conscripted garrison. A serious reform of the Strafrekrutenarmee and Südslawiens-SS is needed to restore stability and order to the region otherwise the collapse of the Arisches-Siedlungsgebiet is inevitable and the control of the \"international jew\" unstoppable.\" §W- Unknown§!"

 SSW_ultimate_goal: "The Ultimate Goal"
 SSW_ultimate_goal_desc: "1949.09.21\n\n### REPORT ON HEINRICH HIMMLER ###\n\n\"After being given control of the Serbian State to strategically displace the SS after suspected subversive activities, Heinrich Himmler has wished to take in large amounts of dangerous prisoners on the Reich's territory into his territory. Due to the current strained justice system in the Reich, the proposal was accepted. The prisoners seem to serve as additional labour force along with the native Serbian people and for military purposes. He poses no threat to our regime currently and can be disregarded for the near future.\" §W- Abwehr Südslawiens Intelligence Report #1§!\n\n\n1951.04.12\n\n### REPORT ON HEINRICH HIMMLER ###\n\n\"After the collapse of our relations with the southeastern Balkan states, Heinrich Himmler has expulsed the Greater German Reich's representative and cut all connections. Some of our agents have been able to convince military officer to reveal that Heinrich Himmler has declared ambitions to expand eastwards due to the failing state of his monetary reserves. The officer was offered an escape plan and amnesty in the Greater German Reich in exchange for his information, was not heard of again after. We were unable to confirm nor deny these plans. We are able to disregard Heinrich Himmler and the SS as a threat in the near future to German interests as his control over the territory is loose and it is unlike that Südslawien will succeed in any expansion.\" §W- Abwehr Südslawien Intelligence Report #7§!"
