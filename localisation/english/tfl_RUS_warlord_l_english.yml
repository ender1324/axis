  RUS_german_bombing: "Winds of Flame, Fields of Ash"
  RUS_german_bombing_desc: "Every soul left clinging to life in the shattered remnants of Russia dreads the distant hum of engines—the harbingers of annihilation from the west. The moment sirens wail, radios crackle with frantic warnings, or panicked screams pierce the air, a collective fear grips the hearts of the survivors. They know what comes next.\n\nFrom across the western bank of the Dvina, the German war machine sends its message of dominance in fire and ruin. Week by week, without pattern or mercy, bombers soar overhead - not to wage war, but to punish. Cities are reduced to training grounds, homes to rubble. No rebuilding is allowed. No future is safe. Every whisper of order or resistance is silenced before it can take root.\n\nRoads vanish beneath craters, workshops burn before a single tool can be raised, and shattered families bury their dead in soil already soaked in ash. Life blackened by smoke and grief.\n\nAnd always, the question haunts the scorched ruins:\n§RHad they not already taken everything?§!"
  RUS_german_bombing_custom_effect_tooltip: "Occasional boming raids will devastate buildings and infrastructure, causing a steady decline in population and stability. The Reich's terror from above will not cease until we strongarm ourselves against it."
  RUS_demographic_crisis: "Ashes of a Nation"
  RUS_demographic_crisis_desc: "What remains of Russia is not rebuilding... it's vanishing.\n\nAcross the frostbitten countryside and the choking ruins of cities, life flickers weakly, starved of warmth, food, and hope. The German terror from above has not only shattered land - it has broken the spirit of a nation. In a land of smoke and grief, children are no longer born. The birthrate has collapsed to near zero, a grim reflection of people too exhausted to dream of the future, too afraid to bring life into a world defined by death.\n\nThe elderly perish in cold homes. The young waste away in forgotten towns. What little growth exists comes from the broken and fleeing refugees escaping the cruelty of the Reich and the hollow promises of better life in the East. But even they arrive with little more than trauma in their eyes and bones in their hands.\n\nThe few officials still calling themselves leaders whisper of \"intervention\" and \"recovery\", but time bleeds away faster than they act. Without immediate, extraordinary measures, there will soon be no Russia left to save—only fading memories of a nation that once was."
  RUS_military_defeatism: "Nothing left to Bleed for"
  RUS_military_defeatism_desc: "\"We have been defeated. We have been shattered. We have been humiliated. I can barely feed my children with a week’s pay, and you ask me to fight? For what? For ashes?\"\n\nNo banners fly with pride. No songs of unity echo in the streets. Across the ruins of Russia, there is only resignation—the bitter knowledge that nothing is coming to save them. Decades of war, occupation, and endless suffering have bled the soul from the people. Patriotism has turned to apathy. Faith in unity has crumbled into dust. The idea of a restored Russia, strong and whole, exists only in the mouths of dying politicians and rusted propaganda posters. The people no longer listen.\n\nThe few who still fight are ghosts of past wars—crippled veterans too proud to surrender, too broken to win. Youth, if it remains at all, dreams not of service or glory, but of escape, anywhere but here. Recruitment is a desperate bargain: food, warmth, the illusion of purpose. But even these promises ring hollow. Should another war come - **and it always does**, Russia will not rise to meet it. It will stagger, fracture, and fall again. Not for lack of strength, but for lack of belief.\n\nThe heart of the nation has stopped beating. All that remains is the eerie silence."
