 GER_never_ending_war: "Nie Endender Krieg"
 GER_never_ending_war_desc: "Every day thousands of young German boys turn 18 and a thousand more are sent to a freezing town in the decaying prisons that are the reichkommissariats to maintain the oppressors rule over it. Many dying in the process, creating even more hatred for those, already in hardships from the brutal occupation.\n\n"Who would want that?" - one might ask. Nobody, but §0Germania§! still insists that it represents the interest of the Aryan."
 GER_uncurbed_ambitions: "Uncurbed Ambitions"
 GER_uncurbed_ambitions_desc: "All former enemies stand before the eagle's heel... Yet that's not enough for the proud Germanic race. Every day more and more children are indoctorated to believe the land from the Atlantic to the Urals is worth their life. And when the great plan for the east is executed, every German shall live like a king and queen..?\n\n§0They all silently wait and endure.§!"
 GER_uncurbed_ambitions_modifier: "§RA dark fate awaits the world if nobody humbles the neverending gluttony of the devil...§!"

 GER_legacy_massacre: "The Legacy of the Massacre"
 GER_legacy_massacre_desc: "In 1949, Goebbles ordered the Wehrmacht to displace of 750 Thousand Russians from their homes in Moskau into the neighbouring towns over the period of 5 years in order to begin the Germanization of the dammed city and make place for \"Germanic\" settlement and immigration. Oh could it have gone more wrong... Hundreds took arms, thousands refused and millions opposed as for they had nothing to lose.\n\n§0The heart of Russia was ripped out of her own body and destroyed.§!"
 GER_legacy_massacre_modifier: "§RThe wrong wire was cut and the bomb is ticking faster...§!"

 GER_false_opportunities: "The False Opportunities..."
 GER_false_opportunities_desc: "To the international eye, the colonization of the east is a blessing for those colonizing. The program offers generous monthly allowance for those living in urban areas away from the \"inferiors\", and free land for those in the rural areas. A free personal servant per family, priority when searching for a job and a life of luxury built on those who they call \"subhumans\". But the grim reality is that the poor families and couples that did agree to that are scared to leave their house, don't have many job opportunities nor much allowance and live in borderline poverty. The ones living in the rural homes get targeted by vengeful partisans, and even the segregated German only streets often get raided. But for them, it's the only choice they have if they want any chance of living outside poverty, and it will all be worth it in the end when the so called barbarians are tamed...\n\n§1Right?§!"

 GER_failure_system: "...And the failure of the system"
 GER_failure_system_desc: "Before the war, NSDAP had managed to convince the working class using extensive welfare and employment programs with generous wages with their reckless spending but after the war had started all of that had to end and be redirected to the endless militarization. Now that the war has ended, we should return to old status quo, §1right?§! Every day, Poles, Estonians, Ukrainians and Russians wake up in crammed communal housing, eat their meager ration and toil at a factory or a mine for 12 to 16 hours a day. And what for? Unemployment is record high. Young men and women unlucky enough to not be considered \"desirable\" by the NPEA universities had to choose to be either to be shipped off to a house in land that doesn't belong to them or find jobs under unsatisfactory conditions. The brain drain caused by the strict racial requirements for higher education has worsened the issue. The economy is on the verge of complete collapse...\n\n§0But the Reichspräsident will still say that we are in the golden age of the \"superior race\".§!"
