When the collapse of the Qing empire happened, we tought that this was could finally be free, but the chinese come and crushed our idea of liberty, our culture was menaced and thus, we revolted against the tyranny of the Hans. After blood was dropped, our republic was proclaimed, but in 1934, the Huis, helped by the Hans destroyed our young nation and we were again under a new foregin ruler of the name of Sheng Shicai. When the Japanese force marched into China, the communists from the east moved to our homeland and etablished their base here, against our faith, the communists tried to destroy our culture and our nationalism, we foughts against them again with the help of Japan, and proclaimed the Second Republic of East Turkestan. Now, our nation lay in the South of Xinjiang, but our goal is not finished, brothers and sisters still are under the filthy goverment of Mao and wait each day for a liberation."

For centuries, our proud people have been oppressed and terrorized by the Han and Hui Hordes of the east, they have sacked our cities and stolen our land. When we formed our first republic by the blood of those who fought, the Huis have took the opportunity to attack us with the help of the barbarian Hans, and so, we were ruled by a tyrannical foreginer who tried to erase our culture with the filthy idea that is communism!\n\nThen, the Japaneses come, and have smashed the chineses, we tought that we could have our liberty, but the communists didn't left us free, they marched by thousands from the east like an horde of invadors, and shackled us while propagating their digusting lie of 'Equality' to wipe out our national unity and identity! They wanted to assimilate our people into their own! They wanted to appropriate the land of our ancestors! But again, we fought, and the Japaneses, the liberators of Asia have come to help us defeat these beasts!\n\nEven if we didn't free all of our homeland, we will not lose hope, the red thiefs of the north are weak, and if you, Türks! join our cause, you will live in peace, free from tyranny forever!"\n\n-Speech of Muhammad Amin Bughra"

They will work you to death and destroy what made you an Türk! They will burn your mosques, since they are the ennemies of Allah!\n\nTürks! for those who even with all the reasons i said, still flee our nation, i want to ask, will you live in peace? knowing that you left the land that your ancestors fought and worked so the next generation could thrive? Will you don't feel any guilt leaving your family, your friends to a uncertain fate? Will you left our ancestral oppresors destorying our country, country where you were born and you lived?
