 ### National Spirits / Ideas
 FFA_birds_cage: "The Bird's Cage"
 FFA_birds_cage_desc: "Across the sandy shores of Dakar, the remnants of the once independent French republican government lies, existing only in land that neither belongs to them, neither wishes to host them.\n\nThe native's discontent with the prolonged martial law grows louder and pan-Africanists influence in the east endangers the rest of the independent west African states, spreading their ideas as far as Senegal and becoming a threat to the fragile French order.\n\nDe Gaulle still insists on consolidating what we have and striking back even harder, even after the devastating defeats that followed the Spanish-Free French Colonial war.\n\n§1Like a bird that keeps trying to escape it's cage.§!"
 FFA_widespread_defeatism: "Widespread Defeatism"
 FFA_widespread_defeatism_desc: "If you question the average soldier still serving the devastated Free French Resistance Army today, they would dismiss or laugh at you on the mention of returning to the Métropole. The reality of the collapse of colonial authority in west Africa destroyed all sense of morale in the  militia.\n\nThe only left French people serving the resistance believe they have nothing left to fight for and the rest of the conscripted natives or hired mercenaries are reluctant at best to fight for a foreign country that oppressed their homeland for so long.\n\nThe garrison keeps operating from the popularity and repeated reassurance by De Gaulle yet they're aware they're not fighting for a cause worth dying for at this point.\n\n§1The candle has been almost extinguished§!"
 FFA_all_alone: "All Alone"
 FFA_all_alone_desc: "Just 3 years ago Free France was a candidate member of the STSD receiving their support which was already controversial enough in the United States supporting an oppressive colonial regime. Stretching across west Africa from Dakar to Niamey the Resistance government used to loosely control almost all of west Africa only being cut short in Niger Delta. Barely holding on, relying on the STSD to send additional garrisons to keep hold of the increasing Pan-Africanist influence from the east, the combined pressure was eventually forcing De Gaulle's hand to liberalize and allow native representation in the government.\n\nThen in 1951 the Spanish ambitions in Mauritania overlapped with the stubbornness of the Free French leadership. Franco demanded the transfer of Mauritania to salvage his fading legitimacy with land gains which was denied by Free France assuming support from the United States. The USA seeing Spain as the more valuable partner abandoned the resistance and they were left to their unfortunate fate. With the already overextended garrisons that had to retreat from territory to defend from the Spanish invasion. This led to the complete collapse of colonial authority and the French holdout in Mauritania breaking. The USA offered De Gaulle refuge in their territory to host a new French Government in Exile, which De Gaulle angerly rejected. Spanish offensives ended and the only territory controlled by the resistance military was Senegal.\n\n§1And the general was exiled all alone again§!"
 FFA_state_of_economy: "State of the Economy"
 FFA_state_of_economy_desc: "Currently most of the Senegalese population lives in complete poverty with the Senegalese economy based on agriculture even though most of the country lies in the Sahel. Currently we are prone to food shortages due to possible droughts. Efforts to diversify and industrialize should be made as fast as possible to restore faith in the colonial government and improve living conditions."
