 GER_adolf_hitler: "Adolf Hitler"
 GER_joseph_goebbels: "Joseph Goebbels"
 GER_joseph_goebbels_desc: "Joseph Goebbels, the master propagandist of the Nazi regime, thrust into the spotlight as the chosen successor to Adolf Hitler in the hopeless world he helped create. Though his ascent to power was not without its challenges, marked by quick and sudden rises that left the §0inner circle§! of the Reich disoriented and fragmented.\n\nIn the tumultuous aftermath of the 1947 riots that threatened to tear Germany apart, Goebbels proved himself a steadfast defender of the Reich, quelling dissent with an iron fist and ensuring the survival of the Nazi regime. This unwavering loyalty to Hitler during the riots and his early support of NSDAP and Hitler himself, earned him his favour and secured his position as the successor.\n\nHis inability to swiftly consolidate power around himself proved to be his undoing. As he grappled with the complexities of governance, his erstwhile comrades in the §0inner circle§! seized the opportunity to secure their own influence, weaving a tangled web of intrigue and betrayal.\n\nAfter the disastrous 1949 Moscow massacre, economic meltdown and the collapse of German influence in the balkans, disillusionment with Goebbels' leadership began to fester among some members of the §0inner circle§!, each harboring their own visions of National Socialism and the future of the Reich. This internal strife, coupled with Goebbels' own ambitions, plunged the Reich into a state of political stagnation and paralysis, exacerbating the economic recession that gripped the nation.\n\nHe finds himself confronted by the harsh realities of socio-economic situation within the Reich. Despite his best efforts, there seems to be no solution in sight, leading him to contemplate the only path that has worked in the past: §Omore war§!, §tmore conquest§!, §Rand more bloodshed.§!\n\nIn the crucible of uncertainty, Goebbels' will and determination are put to the test. But as the Reichstag debates continue stagnating and the wheels of industry grind to a halt, the presidents's grip on power becomes increasingly tenuous. And as the Reich teeters on the brink of collapse, Goebbels knows that his time is running out, and that the fate of the Greater German Reich hangs in the balance."

 SSW_heinrich_himmler: "Heinrich Himmler"
 SSW_heinrich_himmler_desc: "Heinrich Himmler, once the sinister enforcer of the Nazi regime's darkest ambitions, finds himself cast into the shadows of power following the German domination of Europe. Sent to an unofficial exile in Serbia and West Banat, where a significant German minority resides, Himmler seized the opportunity to realize his twisted vision of an "Aryan paradise". §0Little did they know the Pandora's box they had unleashed upon the world...§!\n\nIn the heart of his secluded enclave, Himmler reigns with an iron fist, meticulously orchestrating a regime of surveillance and control. Every whisper, every murmur is scrutinized as he tightens his grip on information flow, ensuring absolute obedience to his will. Yet, amidst the façade of order, §Rthe flames of resistance burn bright as partisan guerrillas wage a relentless war against his rule.§!\n\nUndeterred by the chaos that engulfs the countryside, Himmler embarks on a campaign of ethnic cleansing and settlement. Extermination squads roam the urban land, purging the indigenous Slavic population while German prisoners from mainland Germany are imported to repopulate the emptied cities. §0His ambition knows no bounds as he envisions a utopia forged from the ashes of his atrocities.§!\n\nBut even as he schemes and plots, Himmler is haunted by the specter of his own demise. The foundation of his state, built upon the bones of the innocent, grows increasingly fragile with each passing day. §RThe sands of time slip through his fingers, and even he, the architect of his own tyranny, knows that his reign is but a fleeting moment in history's relentless march.§!\n\nYet, despite the looming shadow of his inevitable downfall, Himmler clings to his delusions with a fervor bordering on madness. In the twilight of his rule, he envisions himself as the master of a new order, an Aryan utopia rising from the ashes of war. But deep down, beneath the veneer of his office, he knows the truth:\n§0his experiment is a ticking time bomb, its collapse inevitable, and even he cannot escape its fate."§!

 RKD_werner_best: "Werner Best"
 RKD_werner_best_desc: "As a high-ranking SS officer during World War II, Best played a pivotal role in the Nazi occupation of Denmark, overseeing the brutal suppression of resistance movements and the imposition of austery measures to maintain control over the occupied territory. His iron-fisted rule and unwavering commitment to the Nazi ideology earned him the trust and favor of Hitler's inner circle, paving the way for his ascension to the position of Reich Plenipotentiary.\n\nUnder Best's command, the collaborationist Danish government was transformed into a puppet regime, subservient to the whims of the Nazi overlords in Germania. Later being transformed to the same Reichkommissariat system as all other occupied territories, he started implementing policies of forced labor, germanization, and cultural suppression, ensuring the complete subjugation of the Danish people to Nazi rule, leaving no room for organized dissent or resistance.\n\nThere isn't anything the common man can do about that. The legitimate government in-exile in the Faroe Islands is powerless against the German hegemon. Any organised resistance is pushed underground, only managing to sabotage and subvert a minor part of the Nazi operations. The Danish people hope and yearn for liberation and justice so his reign of terror may come to an end, §0but the scars of the cultural genocide and defeatism will linger for generations to come.§!"

 RNO_josef_terboven_desc: "During World War II, Terboven served as the Gauleiter of the Nazi Party in Norway, overseeing the occupation of the Scandinavian nation. Known for his his implementation of Nazi racial policies, he wielded absolute power over the occupied populace, subjecting them to the horrors of cultural genoicide while Quisling believed he held some kind of power.\n\nLater Terboven was charged with the task of transforming the occupied territory into a bastion of Nazi ideology and racial purity, which he accepted with a smile. The Nordstern project was started for the creation of a new metropolis located in Øysand, meant to settle German settlers in Norway to slowly start assimilating the local population from top to bottom. Later German language was made the primary language taught in schools and speaking Norwegian was banned in public. History books were rewritten and German ties glorified. \n\nTromsø became a hellish landscape of fear and oppression, with SS militias roaming the streets due to it housing the majority of the underground resistance. Collaborators were rewarded while dissenters were ruthlessly publicly executed, their voices drowned out by the cacophony of Nazi propaganda and terror.\n\nEven after being subjected to all that, the Norwegian people continue opposing the German administration as much as they can. Resistance fighters are housed, the false history opposed and the memories of freedom kept as §0they all hope one day for the often talked about government in-exile to return...§!"

 FFA_charles_degaulle_desc: "Responsibility for Free France's demise weighs heavily upon his shoulders. The betrayal of former allies, the abandonment by the United States, and the relentless advance of the German forces have left him isolated and vulnerable. Yet, he refuses to surrender to despair.\n\nIn a desperate bid to maintain French rule in Africa, De Gaulle turns to harsh measures. Pan-africanists gain ground in the East, threatening the already absent stability he has fought so hard to preserve. Crackdowns on native resistance are often done, trying to preserve the remnants of colonial authority.\n\nBut fate is a cruel mistress, and even the best-laid plans crumble in the face of adversity. The Spanish State's invasion of Mauritania, driven by Franco's colonial ambitions, ignited a powder keg of chaos. The Pan-Africanist militias emerged from the depths of the jungle, while the collaborationist traitors reveal their true colors.\n\nProvince by province, Free France collapsed under the weight of its own decay. De Gaulle and his colonial army retreated to Senegal, holding the border against the encroaching tide of chaos. Survival became their sole objective, as the lack of interest from Spain and the absence of resistance prolong their tenuous existence.\n\nDe Gaulle plots his return, his eyes fixed on reclaiming the old colonial mandates and, ultimately, liberating the French mainland. Though the path ahead is difficult to swallow, he refuses to surrender.\n\n§BFor in the heart of Africa,§! §Wthe flame of French§! §Rresistance still flickers§!."

 NOR_oscar_torp_desc: "Torp served as a prominent figure within the Norwegian Labour Party, advocating for social justice and workers' rights. As the German invasion swept across Norway, he fled alongside other party members to Canada, where they found refuge from the horrors of occupation and tyranny.\n\nIn his role as Prime Minister of the Norwegian Government-in-Exile elected by the exiles, Torp represents the small Norwegian exile community in Canada, providing a voice for those displaced by the ravages of war. Despite the distance from their homeland, he remains dedicated to the fight for Norwegian independence and freedom, working tirelessly to rally support for the resistance operations led by Prince Oskar V.\n\nWhile the prince orchestrates daring missions from the Faroe Islands and Jan Mayen, Torp serves as the diplomatic face of the Norwegian resistance, garnering support from the SOTD and other sympathetic nations around the world. His tireless efforts to keep the flame of Norwegian democracy alive in the face of the new order inspire hope and determination among his compatriots, even as the specter of occupation looms large."

 UZB_nuriddin_muhiddinov_desc: "As the Soviet Union crumbled under the onslaught of German and Japanese invasions, the fissures of dissent rippled through the Central Asian Soviet Republics. The Bukharans, emboldened by the chaos, seized the opportunity to break away, fracturing the unity of the Uzbek Soviet Republic. Left with no military resources to crush the Bukharan secession, Muhiddinov made the fateful decision to secede himself, preserving Uzbek unity at the cost of territorial loss.\n\nAbandoning the communist paint of his rule, Muhiddinov declared himself President-for-Life, consolidating power in his hands and suspending the autonomy of the Karakalpakstan Republic in a bid to maintain stability. Yet, this proved to be a grievous mistake as the simmering discontent in the city of Nukus boiled over into riots, leading to the secession of Karakalpakstan and leaving Uzbekistan a mere rump state.\n\nDespite the challenges that have beset him, Muhiddinov has managed to stabilize Uzbekistan, concentrating most of its activity in the bustling pearl of Central Asia, Tashkent. Yet, the specter of peace fades away as the recovering §RKazakh and Kyrgyz Soviet Republics§! eye the shattered remnants of Central Asia, plotting its §Runity under the red banner§! once more.\n\nDetermined to safeguard his rule against all odds, and with the danger of the §RCentral Asian Soviet Collective§! knocking on his door, Muhiddinov knows he might have to work with the very countries that broke away from Uzbekistan to survive the upcoming onslaught."

 PRC_mao_zedong_desc: "During the cataclysmic backdrop of the Japanese ambitions in World War II, China's fate took a devastating turn. Once divided and helpless before the onslaught of imperial ambitions, the nation found itself torn asunder by the ferocity of the second Sino-Japanese War. In the wake of the Japanese victory, China lays humiliated, its lands carved up and its people subjected to the yoke of foreign domination.\n\nFor Mao, the harrowing realities of occupation served as a crucible, forging his resolve and shaping his destiny. From the blood-soaked fields of guerrilla warfare against Japanese invaders, Mao emerged as a beacon of hope amidst the darkest of hours. As the Japanese juggernaut pushed the United Front out of Eastern China, leaving a trail of devastation in its wake, Mao recognized the urgent need for a new strategy.\n\nFrom the remote bastions of Qinghai and Sinkiang, Mao orchestrates a symphony of resistance, marshaling the leftover collective will of the Chinese people against the occupiers and their collaborationist puppets. With unwavering determination, he leads his forces in a relentless campaign of asymmetrical warfare, often striking at the city of Chengdo.\n\nBut Mao's vision extends beyond the battlefield. It extends far beyond the immediate goal of expelling foreign invaders. It encompasses the revolutionary transformation of Chinese society itself. By mobilizing the masses to actively participate in their own liberation, he seeks to overturn centuries of feudal oppression and imperialist exploitation, laying the groundwork for a truly egalitarian and socialist society. His vision now called §RMaoism§!.\n\nYet, amidst the chaos of war, Mao does not hide his hatred for internal dissent. With ruthless methods, he identifies and removes defeatists and nationalist sympathizers, whose allegiance wavers in the face of adversity. The critical party purges, a necessary and agonizing measure, serve to cleanse the movement of traitors and strengthen its resolve against the collaborationist Kuomintang, whose betrayal inflicted deep wounds upon the nation's spirit.\n\n§RNone shall betray the revolution.§!"
 # As the sun sets over the barren landscapes of Western China, Mao Zedong stands as the leader of the only left centralized resistance. His unwavering commitment to the cause of liberation, even if adjusted to serve his vision, inspire countless souls to join the ranks of the resistance, forging a legacy that will echo through the annals of history. In the resistance, the spirit of China finds its champion, §9its guiding light in the darkest of times.§!"

 CHI_wang_jingwei_desc: "Wang's belief in China's salvation rested solely upon his shoulders. With little faith in China's ability to emerge victorious from the chaos of war, he turned to the Japanese as early as 1938, seeking to lead a government under their auspices. In 1940, his pleas were answered, and he ascended to the position of head of state of the Japanese-backed collaborationist government.\n\nFounded upon the principles of Pan-Asianism, anti-communism, and opposition to Chiang Kai-shek, Wang's government held the promise of a new dawn for China. Yet, as the years passed, he watched helplessly as that promise crumbled before his eyes.\n\nThe Japanese, far from benevolent benefactors, exploited the Pan-Asianist settlement to further their own interests. They tore apart concessions from China, transforming swathes of territory into corporate playgrounds while enforcing extreme demands upon the rest of the nation. Wang's vision of China as an equal partner was shattered, replaced by the grim reality of a nation reduced to a mere exporter of food, goods, and raw resources to Japan.\n\nIn the industrialists' relentless pursuit of profit, China became little more than a sandbox for their experiments, its people mere pawns in their game of power and greed. Wang finds himself powerless to stem the exploitation and despair.\n\§RAnd he will be forever remembered as the man who sold China to the Japanese for nothing§!"

 FER_Konstantin_Rodzaevsky_desc: "Few years after the defeat of the White Armies in the Russian Civil War, Rodzaevsky found refuge in Harbin, where he created and led the Russian Fascist Party with Japanese support. In the chaotic aftermath of the joint German-Japanese invasion of Russia, Rodzaevsky's ambitions were realized as he was installed by the Japanese as the supreme leader of the Russian Fascist Party, with free rein to govern as he saw fit, so long as he adhered to Japanese demands for resource rights and industrial control.\n\nEmbracing a brutal form of corporatism, Rodzaevsky consolidated power in the hands of the state, forming an unstable coalition of party wings and establishing a system that is largely exploited by Japanese zaibatsu. Minority repression policies were ruthlessly implemented against groups such as the Buryats and Yakuts, cementing his grip on power through fear and intimidation.\n\nYet, amidst the iron grip of his rule, cracks began to appear. Demands for the restoration of the monarchy by the White Army presented Rodzaevsky with an opportunity to further legitimize his rule, leading to the crowning of Prince Vsevolod Ivanovich as Tsar of Russia. However, what he perceived as a mere figurehead to bolster his regime may prove to be his greatest mistake.\n\nOpposition within the Russian Fascist Party and the White Army continues to grow, despite frequent purges of vocal opposition, dissent simmers beneath the surface, with many either too afraid to openly oppose Rodzaevsky or driven underground in clandestine resistance movements. As Japanese demands for resources and control escalate, and the Tsar awakens to the realities of his situation, the stability of his rule hangs in the balance.\n\nWith each passing day, his ambitions swell, with dreams of unifying the anarchic territories of Central Russia under his banner with the support of his Japanese puppetmasters and even challenging the German rule over Western Russia, restoring the glory of Russia once and for all. Whether his dreams will be realized or shattered by the harsh realities of the world remains to be seen, but one thing is certain:\n\n§0Konstantin Rodzaevsky will stop at nothing to carve his name into the annals of history.§!"
