 BUK_Abdusattar_I: "Abdusattar I"
 BUK_Abdusattar_I_desc: "Born in the hushed refuge of Kabul, amidst the echoes of a fleeing dynasty, he embodies the resilience and unwavering allegiance to his ancestral homeland. Despite his upbringing in distant lands, his heart remained tethered to the crimson sands and azure domes of Bukhara, where his forefathers once reigned.\n\nIn the wake of the Axis triumph over the Bolshevik regime, when the tides of history reshaped the lands of Asia, Abdusattar Alimi seized the opportunity to return to the land of his birthright. With the §Rcrumbling of the Red grasp§!, he embarked on a triumphant journey back to the hallowed grounds of Bukhara. It was here, amidst the ruins and the promise of rebirth, that he ascended to the throne as the first Emir of the modern Bukharan state.\n\nGuided by a profound sense of duty and a vision for a resplendent future, Abdusattar Alimi now stands at the helm of a nascent nation, eager to chart its course amidst the tumultuous currents of history. Amidst the shifting geopolitical landscape, however, §Rwhispers of revolution linger§!. In the distant reaches of the steppes, the leftovers of the §Rrotting Bolshevik regime§! in Kazakhstan covertly plots to sow seeds of discord, seeking to undermine the sovereignty of Bukhara and return it to the §Rcommunist rot§!. Yet, undeterred by these murmurs of treachery, Abdusattar Alimi remains steadfast in his resolve, drawing strength from the unwavering support of the nobility and the timeless legacy of Bukhara.\n\nUnder his leadership, Bukhara emerged as a surprising bastion of stability and prosperity in a region fraught with uncertainty.\n\nAs the sun sets over the minarets of Bukhara, and the Bolsheviks in the north continue plotting, Abdusattar Alimi stands resolute. In his hands, the legacy of Bukhara finds renewal, and the dreams of its people §Gwill not go unnoticed...§!"

 PRC_mao_zedong: "Mao Zedong"
 PRC_mao_zedong_desc: "Amidst the cataclysmic backdrop of the Japanese ambitions in World War II, China's fate took a devastating turn. Once divided and helpless before the onslaught of imperial ambitions, the nation found itself torn asunder by the ferocity of the second Sino-Japanese War. In the wake of the Japanese victory, China lays humiliated, its lands carved up and its people subjected to the yoke of foreign domination.\n\nFor Mao, the harrowing realities of occupation served as a crucible, forging his resolve and shaping his destiny. From the blood-soaked fields of guerrilla warfare against Japanese invaders, Mao emerged as a beacon of hope amidst the darkest of hours. As the Japanese juggernaut pushed the United Front out of Eastern China, leaving a trail of devastation in its wake, Mao recognized the urgent need for a new strategy.\n\nFrom the remote bastions of Qinghai and Sinkiang, Mao orchestrates a symphony of resistance, marshaling the leftover collective will of the Chinese people against the occupiers and their collaborationist puppets. With unwavering determination, he leads his forces in a relentless campaign of asymmetrical warfare, often striking at the city of Chengdo.\n\nBut Mao's vision extends beyond the battlefield. It extends far beyond the immediate goal of expelling foreign invaders. It encompasses the revolutionary transformation of Chinese society itself. By mobilizing the masses to actively participate in their own liberation, he seeks to overturn centuries of feudal oppression and imperialist exploitation, laying the groundwork for a truly egalitarian and socialist society. His vision now called §RMaoism§!.\nYet, amidst the chaos of war, Mao does not hide his hatred for internal dissent. With ruthless methods, he identifies and removes defeatists and nationalist sympathizers, whose allegiance wavers in the face of adversity. The critical party purges, a necessary and agonizing measure, serve to cleanse the movement of traitors and strengthen its resolve against the collaborationist Kuomintang, whose betrayal inflicted deep wounds upon the nation's spirit.\n\n§RNo shall betray the revolution.§!"
 # As the sun sets over the barren landscapes of Western China, Mao Zedong stands as the leader of the only left centralized resistance. His unwavering commitment to the cause of liberation, even if adjusted to serve his vision, inspire countless souls to join the ranks of the resistance, forging a legacy that will echo through the annals of history. In the resistance, the spirit of China finds its champion, §9its guiding light in the darkest of times.§!"
