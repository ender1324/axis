 #GER_adolf_hitler: "Adolf Hitler"
 GER_joseph_goebbels: "Joseph Goebbels"
 GER_joseph_goebbels_desc: "Joseph Goebbels, once the master propagandist of the Nazi regime, now finds himself thrust into the spotlight as the chosen successor to Adolf Hitler in the tumultuous aftermath of Axis victory. Though his ascent to power was not without its challenges, marked by quick and sudden rises that left the §0inner circle§! of the Reich disoriented and fragmented.\n\nIn the tumultuous aftermath of the 1947 riots that threatened to tear Germany apart, Goebbels proved himself a steadfast defender of the Reich, quelling dissent with an iron fist and ensuring the survival of the Nazi regime. This unwavering loyalty to Hitler during the riots earned him the favour of Hitler and him naming him his successor.\n\nHis inability to swiftly consolidate power around himself proved to be his undoing. As he grappled with the complexities of governance, his erstwhile comrades in the §0inner circle§! seized the opportunity to secure their own influence, weaving a tangled web of intrigue and betrayal.\n\nAfter the disastrous 1949 Moscow massacre, almost daily riots by the population and economic destruction, disillusionment with Goebbels' leadership began to fester among some members of the §0inner circle§!, each harboring their own visions of National Socialism and the future of the Reich. This internal strife, coupled with Goebbels' own ambitions, plunged the Reich into a state of political stagnation and paralysis, exacerbating the economic recession that gripped the nation.\n\nHe finds himself confronted by the harsh realities of economic recession within the Reich. Despite his best efforts, there seems to be no solution in sight, leading him to contemplate the only path he knows: §Omore war§!, §tmore conquest§!, §Rand more bloodshed.§!\n\nIn the crucible of uncertainty, Goebbels' will and determination are put to the test. But as the Reichstag debates continue stagnating and the wheels of industry grind to a halt, the presidents's grip on power becomes increasingly tenuous. And as the Reich teeters on the brink of collapse, Goebbels knows that his time is running out, and that the fate of the Greater German Reich hangs in the balance."

 SSW_heinrich_himmler: "Heinrich Himmler"
 SSW_heinrich_himmler_desc: "Heinrich Himmler, once the sinister enforcer of the Nazi regime's darkest ambitions, finds himself cast into the shadows of power following the Axis triumph in World War II. Sentenced to an unofficial exile in Serbia and West Banat, where a significant German minority resides, Himmler seized the opportunity to realize his twisted vision of an "Aryan paradise". §0Little did they know the Pandora's box they had unleashed upon the world...§!\n\nIn the heart of his secluded enclave, Himmler reigns with an iron fist, meticulously orchestrating a regime of surveillance and control. Every whisper, every murmur is scrutinized as he tightens his grip on information flow, ensuring absolute obedience to his will. Yet, amidst the façade of order, §Rthe flames of resistance burn bright as partisan guerrillas wage a relentless war against his rule.§!\n\nUndeterred by the chaos that engulfs the countryside, Himmler embarks on a campaign of ethnic cleansing and settlement. Extermination squads roam the urban land, purging the indigenous Slavic population while German prisoners from mainland Germany are imported to repopulate the emptied cities. §0His ambition knows no bounds as he envisions a utopia forged from the ashes of his atrocities.§!\n\nBut even as he schemes and plots, Himmler is haunted by the specter of his own demise. The foundation of his state, built upon the bones of the innocent, grows increasingly fragile with each passing day. §RThe sands of time slip through his fingers, and even he, the architect of his own tyranny, knows that his reign is but a fleeting moment in history's relentless march.§!\n\nYet, despite the looming shadow of his inevitable downfall, Himmler clings to his delusions with a fervor bordering on madness. In the twilight of his rule, he envisions himself as the master of a new order, an Aryan utopia rising from the ashes of war. But deep down, beneath the veneer of his façade, he knows the truth:\n§0his experiment is a ticking time bomb, its collapse inevitable, and even he cannot escape its fate."§!

 UZB_nuriddin_muhiddinov: "Nuriddin Muhiddinov"
 UZB_nuriddin_muhiddinov_desc: "As the Soviet Union crumbled under the onslaught of German and Japanese invasions, the fissures of dissent rippled through the Central Asian Soviet Republics. The Bukharans, emboldened by the chaos, seized the opportunity to break away, fracturing the unity of the Uzbek Soviet Republic. Left with no military resources to crush the Bukharan secession, Muhiddinov made the fateful decision to secede himself, preserving Uzbek unity at the cost of territorial loss.\n\nAbandoning the communist paint of his rule, Muhiddinov declared himself President-for-Life, consolidating power in his hands and suspending the autonomy of the Karakalpakstan Republic in a bid to maintain stability. Yet, this proved to be a grievous mistake as the simmering discontent in the city of Nukus boiled over into riots, leading to the secession of Karakalpakstan and leaving Uzbekistan a mere rump state.\n\nDespite the challenges that have beset him, Muhiddinov has managed to stabilize Uzbekistan, concentrating most of its activity in the bustling pearl of Central Asia, Tashkent. Yet, the specter of peace fades away as the recovering §RKazakh and Kyrgyz Soviet Republics§! eye the shattered remnants of Central Asia, plotting its §Runity under the red banner§! once more.\n\nDetermined to safeguard his rule against all odds, and with the danger of the §RCentral Asian Soviet Collective§! knocking on his door, Muhiddinov knows he might have to work with the very countries that broke away from Uzbekistan to survive the upcoming onslaught."

 BUK_Abdusattar_I_desc: "Born in the hushed refuge of Kabul, amidst the echoes of a fleeing dynasty, he embodies the resilience and unwavering allegiance to his ancestral homeland. Despite his upbringing in distant lands, his heart remained tethered to the crimson sands and azure domes of Bukhara, where his forefathers once reigned.\n\nIn the wake of the Axis triumph over the Bolshevik regime, when the tides of history reshaped the lands of Asia, Abdusattar Alimi seized the opportunity to return to the land of his birthright. With the §Rcrumbling of the Red grasp§!, he embarked on a triumphant journey back to the hallowed grounds of Bukhara. It was here, amidst the ruins and the promise of rebirth, that he ascended to the throne as the first Emir of the modern Bukharan state.\n\nGuided by a profound sense of duty and a vision for a resplendent future, Abdusattar Alimi now stands at the helm of a nascent nation, eager to chart its course amidst the tumultuous currents of history. Amidst the shifting geopolitical landscape, however, §Rwhispers of revolution linger§!. In the distant reaches of the steppes, the leftovers of the §Rrotting Bolshevik regime§! in Kazakhstan covertly plots to sow seeds of discord, seeking to undermine the sovereignty of Bukhara and return it to the §Rcommunist rot§!. Yet, undeterred by these murmurs of treachery, Abdusattar Alimi remains steadfast in his resolve, drawing strength from the unwavering support of the nobility and the timeless legacy of Bukhara.\n\nUnder his leadership, Bukhara emerged as a surprising bastion of stability and prosperity in a region fraught with uncertainty.\n\nAs the sun sets over the minarets of Bukhara, and the Bolsheviks in the north continue plotting, Abdusattar Alimi stands resolute. In his hands, the legacy of Bukhara finds renewal, and the dreams of its people §Gwill not go unnoticed...§!"

 PRC_mao_zedong: "Mao Zedong"
 PRC_mao_zedong_desc: "Amidst the cataclysmic backdrop of the Japanese ambitions in World War II, China's fate took a devastating turn. Once divided and helpless before the onslaught of imperial ambitions, the nation found itself torn asunder by the ferocity of the second Sino-Japanese War. In the wake of the Japanese victory, China lays humiliated, its lands carved up and its people subjected to the yoke of foreign domination.\n\nFor Mao, the harrowing realities of occupation served as a crucible, forging his resolve and shaping his destiny. From the blood-soaked fields of guerrilla warfare against Japanese invaders, Mao emerged as a beacon of hope amidst the darkest of hours. As the Japanese juggernaut pushed the United Front out of Eastern China, leaving a trail of devastation in its wake, Mao recognized the urgent need for a new strategy.\n\nFrom the remote bastions of Qinghai and Sinkiang, Mao orchestrates a symphony of resistance, marshaling the leftover collective will of the Chinese people against the occupiers and their collaborationist puppets. With unwavering determination, he leads his forces in a relentless campaign of asymmetrical warfare, often striking at the city of Chengdo.\n\nBut Mao's vision extends beyond the battlefield. It extends far beyond the immediate goal of expelling foreign invaders. It encompasses the revolutionary transformation of Chinese society itself. By mobilizing the masses to actively participate in their own liberation, he seeks to overturn centuries of feudal oppression and imperialist exploitation, laying the groundwork for a truly egalitarian and socialist society. His vision now called §RMaoism§!.\n\nYet, amidst the chaos of war, Mao does not hide his hatred for internal dissent. With ruthless methods, he identifies and removes defeatists and nationalist sympathizers, whose allegiance wavers in the face of adversity. The critical party purges, a necessary and agonizing measure, serve to cleanse the movement of traitors and strengthen its resolve against the collaborationist Kuomintang, whose betrayal inflicted deep wounds upon the nation's spirit.\n\n§RNone shall betray the revolution.§!"
 # As the sun sets over the barren landscapes of Western China, Mao Zedong stands as the leader of the only left centralized resistance. His unwavering commitment to the cause of liberation, even if adjusted to serve his vision, inspire countless souls to join the ranks of the resistance, forging a legacy that will echo through the annals of history. In the resistance, the spirit of China finds its champion, §9its guiding light in the darkest of times.§!"
