ENG_Tamed_Lion: "A Tamed Lion"
ENG_Tamed_Lion_desc: "Once, Britain was the master of the world, its mighty fleet ruled the waves and the sun never set on its empire. But when the panzers marched on London, this era of prosperity was wiped out. The lion was defeated by the eagle, who overthrew the current king and replaced him with Edwar VIII, a german collaborator. The empire that had ruled the world was torn apart, its jewel fell into chaos and Africa was lost. Day by day, the memory of English glory fades as people see the German flag flying over Big Ben."
ENG_Free_British_Corps: "British Free Corps"
ENG_Free_British_Corps_desc: " To preserve the stability of the regime, we realized that our bobbies weren't enough to stop the riots and demonstrations, and as we were looking for a better way to control the population, the Germans proposed using the British Free Corps, a waffen-ss division made up of prisoners of war and led by Thomas Haller Cooper. This set-up helped us a lot, the free corps brought stability to the regime by terrorizing the population, but their brutality became a problem for those who wanted to reform the kingdom, and it didn't help when Cooper started to take an interest in politics and even won a few seats in parliament, attacking the corps could have horrible consequences for England."
ENG_Legacy_of_the_Bombings: "The Legacy of Bombing"
ENG_Legacy_of_the_Bombings_desc: "When German planes flew over London, they sowed death and ruin in their wake; streets were razed to the ground, roads were full of holes and only the bunkers provided a safe haven. Even after the war, our weak economy didn't allow us to rebuild the city in all its glory, there are still remains of ruined buildings next to the Palace of Westminster and our factories need repair if we are to prosper."
